| Category | Exemplary | Meets Expectations | Revision Needed | Not Assessable |
|----------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Project effectively utilizes the technologies and techniques specified in the project objectives** | - Logging framework used (no `System.out.println()` or `printStacktrace()`). <br> - JPA/Hibernate used for all data access. <br> - Authentication/Authorization implemented using a third party provider. <br> - Provides ability to register a new user. <br> - Consumes at least one web service or public API (in addition to those required) using Java. <br> - Application is database-driven with full CRUD. <br> - Database includes multiple one-to-many relationships. <br> - Deployed to AWS for public access. <br> - Meets MVP (minimum viable product). <br> - Implements best practices (e.g., data validation). | Fulfilled most of the scope. | Fulfilled some significant portions of the project scope. | Barely fulfilled the scope: significant portions missing. |
| **Synthesis of multiple concepts in unfamiliar situations requiring research beyond the scope of the class** | - Experiments individually, shows independence and drive, originality in solution. <br> - Implemented 2+ technologies not covered in class, or 1 complex technology. <br> - Demonstrates ability to independently troubleshoot and debug. | Experiments with some reliance on instructor/others. <br> Implemented 1 technology not covered in class. | Attempted with heavy reliance on instructor. | No observable interest or effort shown. |
| **Code is readable, documented, efficient and well-tested** | - Exceptionally organized and easy to follow. <br> - Documentation clearly explains purpose and design. <br> - Extremely efficient without sacrificing readability. <br> - Significant test coverage. | Code fairly easy to follow. <br> Documentation somewhat useful. <br> Code efficient. <br> Moderate test coverage. | Code somewhat unclear. <br> Documentation incomplete. <br> Inefficiencies exist. <br> Some test coverage. | Poorly organized. <br> Minimal/unhelpful documentation. <br> Unnecessarily long/complex code. <br> Little to no test coverage. |
| **Demonstrates initiative and thoughtful planning to leverage available resources (time, equipment, external expertise) and meet milestones** | Demonstrates initiative and thoughtful planning; milestones met. | Demonstrates initiative and planning; intermediate milestones met. | Some initiative; a milestone might have been missed. | Minimal planning, missed milestones, or underutilized resources. |
| **Evidence of significant revision and incorporation of feedback** | Significant revision and incorporation of feedback, resulting in major improvement. | Some revision and feedback incorporation, resulting in improvement. | Minor revision only, minimal improvement. | Little to no revision or feedback incorporation. |
| **Complexity** | Complex | Difficult | Average | Simple |
| **Final Presentation** | - Engaging, enthusiastic, relevant, comprehensive, clear. <br> - Innovative and effective aids. <br> - High technical understanding. <br> - Time well managed. <br> - Video demonstration link in README. | Well-delivered, smooth, relevant, understandable. <br> Supporting materials used effectively. <br> Able to explain most technical concepts. | Audience can follow but with disconnects. <br> Presentation heavily scripted. <br> Supporting materials used but not explained well. <br> Explains some technical concepts. | Difficult to follow, flow issues. <br> Supporting materials not explained or misused. <br> Explains few technicalities. <br> Time poorly managed. |
