# CodeForge 🔥

**CodeForge** is a Java-based coding practice platform that helps students and developers strengthen their algorithm and problem-solving skills.  
Think of it as a simpler, friendlier alternative to LeetCode — focused on clarity, fundamentals, and mastery through repetition.

## 🎯 Features (Planned / In Progress)
- **Practice Mode**  
  Browse algorithm challenges by topic and difficulty, write your solution, and get instant test feedback.

- **Drill Mode**  
  A “flashcard for code” system. Missed or skipped problems come back in future cycles until you solve them correctly — with some solved ones mixed in to re-check your mastery.

- **Progress Tracking**
  Track your problem status (`Correct`, `Acceptable`, `Incorrect`, `Skipped`) and see your overall improvement over time.

- **Expandable Challenge Set**  
  Admins/instructors can easily add new problems, test cases, and starter code to grow the platform.

## 📚 Challenge Topics
CodeForge will include challenges from:
- Arrays & Strings
- HashMaps & Sets
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Linked Lists & Trees (basics → moderate)
- Introductory Dynamic Programming

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Java** (Enterprise Java focus)
- **Servlets/JSP** or **Spring Boot** (depending on class requirements)
- **JUnit** for automated solution testing
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for user data and challenge storage
- **IntelliJ IDEA** as the development environment

## 👩‍💻 Project Purpose
This project is part of my Enterprise Java class.
The goal is to demonstrate building a full-stack Java web app with authentication, persistence, and real-world application value — while creating a tool that can actually help practice coding interviews.

---
## 📌 Roadmap
- [ ] Initial project setup
- [ ] User auth & progress tracking
- [ ] Problem database + admin interface
- [ ] Practice mode (basic submission → test feedback)
- [ ] Drill mode with spaced-repetition queue
- [ ] Polished UI + expanded problem library
