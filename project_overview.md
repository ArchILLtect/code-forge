# Individual Project

## Overview

The Individual Enterprise Java Project is designed to facilitate your transition from Madison College to an industry career through the development of a high-quality software product. 
The project will encourage you to think critically and solve challenging problems while developing skills critical to a successful career in Information Technology. 
Upon completion, this project will be an important part of your portfolio to be shared with potential employers.

## Objectives

- Create an innovative, data-driven Java website or application that solves a problem of interest to you.
- Demonstrate effective use of the technologies and techniques learned in the program, with emphasis on Enterprise Java [ðŸ”—competencies](https://paulawaite.com/education/java113/competencies.html), including:
  - Authentication and authorization. At minimum, register a new user and log into the application using an identity service such as AWS Cognito, Google Auth, etc.
  - Logging using a framework => Log4J
  - Unit testing using a framework => jUnit
  - Object relational mapping (ORM) framework for all database access => JPA/Hibernate
  - Web service(s) (at least one) consumed using Java
- Demonstrate proper use of UI elements to create a visually pleasing, responsive application.
- Create a well-structured Java project following industry best practices.
- Use version control.
- Demonstrate the ability to effectively plan project work and execute that plan.
- Demonstrate the ability to independently troubleshoot and debug.
- Document the process and progress of the project.
- Articulate the application architecture and explain the technologies used.

## Deliverables

- Problem statement, user stories, and project plan (detailed schedule for your project). Must be approved by instructor.
- Screen design and application flow.
- Completion of at least 2 design/code reviews with at least 2 peers and the instructor.
- Regular (minimum of weekly) reflection statement documenting progress and time spent on the project and course work.
- Source code, HTML Javadoc and all supporting materials, e.g., design documents, published on GitHub.
- Deploy the application to a publicly accessible location, i.e., hosted on AWS.
- Present completed project to the class. Demonstrate the application, explain the application architecture and discuss significant technical aspects of the project with emphasis on your independent research technology.
- Video demonstration of the completed application â€“ a link to the publicly accessible video in your project readme.md on GitHub.

## Checkpoints

- **Checkpoint 1:** Problem statement, user stories, project plan, screen design and reflection statements pushed to GitHub. Be sure to identify which stories are part of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Link to your repository [ðŸ”—here](https://github.com/mad-ent-java-f25/student/blob/main/IndividualProjects.md) *Week 4*.
- **Checkpoint 2:** Database designed and created, at least one DAO with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) implemented with Hibernate, DAO is fully unit tested, Log4J is implemented (no System.out.printlns). *Week 7*.
- **Checkpoint 3:** Deployed to AWS, at least one JSP that displays data from the database is implemented, authentication implemented. Add link to your deployed application [ðŸ”—here](https://github.com/mad-ent-java-f25/student/blob/main/IndividualProjects.md). *Week 9*.
