## Problem Statement (Final)

### Working title: CodeForge – Java Coding Practice & Drills

Students and new developers struggle to find a focused way to practice Java fundamentals (collections, OOP, I/O, testing) with fast feedback and repeat exposure to weak areas. Generic coding sites are broad and language‑agnostic, making it hard to align with an Enterprise Java course’s competencies (Servlets/JSP, JPA/Hibernate, logging, testing, CI).

### CodeForge solves this by providing a Java‑centric practice platform with two modes:

- **Practice:** Browse challenges, submit Java solutions, run against unit tests, view results and hints.

- **Drill:** Spaced‑repetition resurfacing of missed or weak challenges to reinforce learning.

The app emphasizes clean Java, DAO/JPA/Hibernate persistence, JUnit‑based evaluation, structured logging, and a relational DB for tracking progress. It’s intentionally scoped to an MVP that can be completed and demoed within the semester, while leaving clear paths for stretch features (auth providers, leaderboards, tags/search, admin content tools).

---

**Primary users:** learners (students, self‑taught devs). Secondary users: instructors/admins who curate challenges.

**Measurable outcome:** Within 3 weeks of MVP release, a learner can complete 10+ challenges with a 20% reduction in repeat errors on resurfaced drills (measured by drill score history).
