# Individual Project
## Overview
The Individual Enterprise Java Project is designed to facilitate your transition from Madison College to an industry career though the development of a high-quality software product. The project will encourage you to think critically and solve challenging problems while developing skills critical to a successful career in Information Technology. Upon completion, this project will be an important part of the your portfolio to be shared with potential employers.

### Objectives
- Create an innovative, data-driven Java web site or application that solves a problem of interest to you.
- Demonstrate effective use of the technologies and techniques learned in the program, with emphasis on Enterprise Java competencies, including
  - Authentication and authorization. At minimum, register a new user and log into the application using an identity service such as AWS Cognito, Google Auth, etc.
  - Logging using a framework => Log4J
  - Unit testing using a framework => jUnit
  - Object relational mapping (ORM) framework for all database access => JPA/Hibernate
  - Web service/s (at least one) consumed using Java.
- Demonstrate proper use of UI elements to create a visually pleasing, responsive application.
- Create a well-structured Java project following industry best practices.
- Use version control.
- Demonstrate the ability to effectively plan project work and execute that plan.
- Demonstrate the ability to independently troubleshoot and debug.
- Document the process and progress of the project.
- Articulate the application architecture and explain the technologies used.

### Deliverables
- Problem statement, user stories, and project plan (detailed schedule for your project). Must be approved by instructor.
- Screen design and application flow.
- Complete at least 2 design/code reviews with at least 2 peers and the instructor.
- Regular (minimum of weekly) reflection statement documenting progress and time spent on the project and course work.
- Source code, HTML JavaDoc and all supporting materials, e.g., design documents, published on GitHub.
- Deploy the application to a publicly accessible location, i.e., hosted on AWS.
- Present completed project to the class. Demonstrate the application, explain the application architecture and discuss significant technical aspects of the project with emphasis on your independent research technology.
- Video demonstration of the completed application - a link to the publicly accessible video in your project readme.md in GitHub.

### Checkpoints
- Checkpoint 1: Problem statement, user stories, project plan, screen design and reflection statements pushed to GitHub. Be sure to identify which stories are part of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Link to your repository here. Week 4.
- Checkpoint 2: Database designed and created, at least one DAO with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) implemented with Hibernate, DAO is fully unit tested, Log4J is implemented (no System.out.printlns). Week 7.
- Checkpoint 3: Deployed to AWS, at least one JSP that displays data from the database is implemented, authentication implemented. Add link to your deployed application here. Week 9.

## Project Rubric

| Category | Exemplary | Meets Expectations | Revision Needed | Not Assessable |
|----------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Project effectively utilizes the technologies and techniques specified in the project objectives** | - Logging framework used (no `System.out.println()` or `printStacktrace()`). <br> - JPA/Hibernate used for all data access. <br> - Authentication/Authorization implemented using a third party provider. <br> - Provides ability to register a new user. <br> - Consumes at least one web service or public API (in addition to those required) using Java. <br> - Application is database-driven with full CRUD. <br> - Database includes multiple one-to-many relationships. <br> - Deployed to AWS for public access. <br> - Meets MVP (minimum viable product). <br> - Implements best practices (e.g., data validation). | Fulfilled most of the scope. | Fulfilled some significant portions of the project scope. | Barely fulfilled the scope: significant portions missing. |
| **Synthesis of multiple concepts in unfamiliar situations requiring research beyond the scope of the class** | - Experiments individually, shows independence and drive, originality in solution. <br> - Implemented 2+ technologies not covered in class, or 1 complex technology. <br> - Demonstrates ability to independently troubleshoot and debug. | Experiments with some reliance on instructor/others. <br> Implemented 1 technology not covered in class. | Attempted with heavy reliance on instructor. | No observable interest or effort shown. |
| **Code is readable, documented, efficient and well-tested** | - Exceptionally organized and easy to follow. <br> - Documentation clearly explains purpose and design. <br> - Extremely efficient without sacrificing readability. <br> - Significant test coverage. | Code fairly easy to follow. <br> Documentation somewhat useful. <br> Code efficient. <br> Moderate test coverage. | Code somewhat unclear. <br> Documentation incomplete. <br> Inefficiencies exist. <br> Some test coverage. | Poorly organized. <br> Minimal/unhelpful documentation. <br> Unnecessarily long/complex code. <br> Little to no test coverage. |
| **Demonstrates initiative and thoughtful planning to leverage available resources (time, equipment, external expertise) and meet milestones** | Demonstrates initiative and thoughtful planning; milestones met. | Demonstrates initiative and planning; intermediate milestones met. | Some initiative; a milestone might have been missed. | Minimal planning, missed milestones, or underutilized resources. |
| **Evidence of significant revision and incorporation of feedback** | Significant revision and incorporation of feedback, resulting in major improvement. | Some revision and feedback incorporation, resulting in improvement. | Minor revision only, minimal improvement. | Little to no revision or feedback incorporation. |
| **Complexity** | Complex | Difficult | Average | Simple |
| **Final Presentation** | - Engaging, enthusiastic, relevant, comprehensive, clear. <br> - Innovative and effective aids. <br> - High technical understanding. <br> - Time well managed. <br> - Video demonstration link in README. | Well-delivered, smooth, relevant, understandable. <br> Supporting materials used effectively. <br> Able to explain most technical concepts. | Audience can follow but with disconnects. <br> Presentation heavily scripted. <br> Supporting materials used but not explained well. <br> Explains some technical concepts. | Difficult to follow, flow issues. <br> Supporting materials not explained or misused. <br> Explains few technicalities. <br> Time poorly managed. |
