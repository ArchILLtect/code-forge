## 27) Feature: Drill submission flow (UI + Controller + Service wiring)

- Title
  - feat(drill): Drill submission flow using stub runner; update DrillItem and redirect to next due
- Problem / context
  - DrillService and ChallengeRunService exist, but there is no user-facing Drill flow to submit code and advance the due queue.
- Proposed solution
  - Add DrillController with endpoints:
    - GET /drill — show queue summary (top N) with CTA
    - GET /drill/next — resolve next due and redirect to /drill/{id}, or show friendly empty state
    - GET /drill/{id} — solve page with prompt, language select (java), and code textarea
    - POST /drill/{id}/submit — run stub, map to Outcome, DrillService.recordOutcome, flash message, redirect to /drill/next
  - Views (JSP): drill/queue.jsp and drill/solve.jsp
  - Show flash outcome after submit; add brief tip explaining the stub runner behavior.
- In scope
  - Controller, JSPs, wiring to ChallengeRunService and DrillService, flash messages, empty-queue UX
- Out of scope
  - Real code execution or sandboxing, advanced editor features (tracked separately)
- Acceptance criteria
  - [ ] /drill shows a due summary with CTA to continue
  - [ ] /drill/next redirects to a due challenge or shows a friendly message if none
  - [ ] /drill/{id} renders solve JSP with prompt and form
  - [ ] POST /drill/{id}/submit persists Submission, updates DrillItem, redirects to next due, shows flash outcome
- Area
  - area:web, area:service
- Dependencies / related issue
  - Uses existing DrillService and ChallengeRunService
- Suggested labels
  - status:triage, enhancement, feature:drill-mode, priority:P1-high, area:web, area:service

## 28) Security: Guard Drill routes (AuthGuardFilter)

- Title
  - feat(security): Protect Drill routes via AuthGuardFilter (MVP)
- Problem / context
  - Drill routes must require login; unauthenticated users should be redirected to /logIn.
- Proposed solution
  - Extend AuthGuardFilter to require auth for:
    - GET /drill, GET /drill/*, POST /drill/*/submit
  - Keep home, challenge list/detail, and health public.
- In scope
  - Filter updates and tests
- Out of scope
  - Spring Security OIDC migration (tracked post-MVP)
- Acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Unauthenticated access to any Drill route redirects to /logIn
  - [ ] Authenticated users can access Drill pages and submit

  - area:security, area:web
- Dependencies / related issue
  - #27) Drill submission flow (routes must be protected)
- Suggested labels
  - status:triage, enhancement, area:security, priority:P1-high

## 29) Tests: DrillService scheduling and recordOutcome coverage

- Title
  - test(service): Coverage for Drill scheduling rules and recordOutcome
- Problem / context
  - Need tests to validate nextDueAt, streak, timesSeen rules and queue behavior.
- Proposed solution
  - Add unit tests for DrillService:
    - recordOutcome for CORRECT, ACCEPTABLE, INCORRECT, SKIPPED
    - getDueQueue ordering (due first, nulls first), and fallback to soonest when none due
- In scope
  - Unit/service tests only
- Out of scope
  - WebMvc; covered in a separate issue
- Acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Tests assert correct updates to streak/timesSeen/nextDueAt per outcome
  - [ ] Queue ordering rules covered; fallback path verified
- Area
  - area:service, status:needs-tests
- Dependencies / related issue
  - #27) Drill submission flow (uses these rules)

## 30) Tests: DrillController WebMvc tests

- Title
  - test(web): WebMvc coverage for DrillController routes and redirects
- Problem / context
  - Ensure the Drill flow pages render and redirects occur as expected, including unauthenticated redirects.
- Proposed solution
  - WebMvc tests:
    - GET /drill/next when due exists → redirect to /drill/{id}
    - GET /drill/{id} renders solve JSP (session user present)
    - POST /drill/{id}/submit uses stub outcome, sets flash, redirects to /drill/next
    - Unauthenticated attempts to Drill routes → redirected to /logIn by filter
- In scope
  - WebMvc tests with view resolver and session attrs
- Out of scope
  - Full integration tests
- Acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Tests cover the above scenarios and pass
- Area
  - area:web, status:needs-tests

## 31) Persistence hygiene: Review fetch/cascade for DrillItem and Submission

- Title
  - chore(persistence): Review lazy/eager and cascade settings for Drill entities
- Problem / context
  - Avoid orphan rows and unintended cascades as submissions are created and items deleted.
- Proposed solution
  - Audit mappings and adjust fetch/cascade where sensible; add 1–2 DAO tests if changes are made
- In scope
  - Mapping review and small tests (only if changes are made)
- Out of scope
  - Broad refactors or performance tuning
- Acceptance criteria
  - [ ] No unexpected orphans in basic delete paths; mappings remain sane

## 38) Hardening: DAO MVP Implementation – Transaction boundaries and optimistic locking prep

- Title
  - chore(persistence): Move transactions to service layer; prep DrillItem for future locking

- Problem / context
  - Current flow works, but transactions are declared at the controller level (e.g., DrillController), which can blur service boundaries and complicate debugging. For the MVP, transactions should be applied only where data access actually occurs.

- Proposed solution
  - Transaction boundaries
    - Remove @Transactional annotations from controller methods.
    - Keep transactions only at the service or DAO layer.
    - Mark read-only methods explicitly with @Transactional(readOnly = true) when appropriate.

  - Preparation for future hardening
    - Add @Version Long version; field to DrillItem entity to enable future optimistic locking.
    - No schema migration yet—just annotate and verify compile/test pass.

- In scope
  - Code updates in DrillService and other service classes to manage transaction boundaries.
  - Add @Version to DrillItem (no Flyway/Liquibase changes yet).Add @Version to DrillItem (no Flyway/Liquibase changes yet).

- Out of scope
  - Add @Version to DrillItem (no Flyway/Liquibase changes yet).Database-level unique constraints or race-condition handling.
  - Add @Version to DrillItem (no Flyway/Liquibase changes yet).Concurrency tests and full Flyway migration (deferred to later issue).

- Acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Controllers have no @Transactional annotations.
  - [ ] All service/DAO methods use appropriate transactional annotations.
  - [ ] DrillItem includes a @Version field for later optimistic locking.
  - [ ] Application builds and tests pass without behavioral regressions.

- Area
  - area:persistence, area:service, area:web, hardening

- Dependencies / related issues
  - #27) Drill submission flow (uses DrillService)
  - #31) Persistence hygiene (fetch/cascade review)
  - Week 8 deployment (Hibernate auto-DDL); Flyway adoption post-MVP

- Suggested labels
  - status:triage, priority:P1-high, hardening, area:persistence


## 40) Post-MVP Hardening

- Title
  - feat(persistence): Enforce one DrillItem per Challenge; handle concurrency and race conditions

- Problem / context
  - Under concurrent load, duplicate DrillItem rows could be created for the same Challenge, and concurrent updates might overwrite streak/nextDueAt values (lost updates).

- Proposed solution
  - Uniqueness & race handling
    - Enforce one DrillItem per Challenge via a unique constraint (drill_items.challenge_id).
    - Update getOrCreateDrillItem to catch DataIntegrityViolationException and re-fetch the existing record.
  - Optimistic locking
    - Utilize the @Version field added in MVP.
  - Tests
    - Add DAO/service concurrency tests for create/update race scenarios.
  - Index
    - Add unique index on drill_items.challenge_id in Flyway/Liquibase migration (post-MVP; not in Week 8 scope).

- In scope
  - Service/DAO concurrency handling and tests.
  - Schema constraint via migration (post-MVP milestone).

- Out of scope
  - Refactoring unrelated domain entities.
  - Non-persistence optimizations.

- Acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Unique constraint prevents duplicate DrillItem per Challenge.
  - [ ] Concurrent updates use optimistic locking (@Version).
  - [ ] Concurrency tests confirm correctness and stability.
  - [ ] All existing tests remain green.

- Area
  - area:persistence, hardening, concurrency

- Dependencies / related issues
  - #38) DAO MVP Implementation (adds @Version)
  - Post-MVP migration plan (Flyway)

- Suggested labels
  - status:backlog, priority:P3-low, hardening, migration
